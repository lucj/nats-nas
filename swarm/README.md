## Create a swarm

```
docker swarm init
```

## Deploy NATS Server Account and NATS Server

```
./deploy-NAS-NATS.sh
```

## Create APP / APPU (admin user)

```
./create-admin.sh
```

Make sure the pub/sub is working fine with this user:
(this is using the creds file generated by the previous command)

```terminal1
nats-sub -creds ./secrets/APPU.creds ">"
```

```terminal2
nats-pub -creds ./secrets/APPU.creds ">" hello
```

## Create client account + user

```
./create-client.sh user2 "users.user1.>"
```

Makge sure it's working fine:
(this is using the creds file generated by the previous command)

```terminal1
nats-sub -creds ./secrets/user1.creds "users.user1.>"
Listening on [users.user1.>]
```

```terminal2
nats-pub -creds ./secrets/APPU.creds "users.user1.events" hello
Published [users.user1.events] : 'hello'
```

Currently facing an issue as the user1 does not receive any messages (unless NATS is restarted)
